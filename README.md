Congrats! In one way or another, you've found this repository! This exists as sort of a memorial for Scratch as it has really been a lot to me.

## Part One - Discovering Scratch
I came across Scratch in 2019-2020ish. Prior to that, I used ScratchJr. Now, ~I didn't have an account at the time, but~<br/> 
~I did make one account, I think. It was called nintendofan200000~<br/> 
Nope, give me a moment while I recollect my memories.

I think I did try to make a few things, back before I made an account...<br/>
...but didn't do very well.

## Part Two - The Creation of My Accounts
In April of 2022, I made my first account. (I think, this is the earliest I can track it down to.) It's called nintendofan200000 and it only had one unshared project: "Cow Dodge! remix". I later shared this after rediscovering it on January 4th, 2025.

BONUS: The account's password is `Pikachu`. Really unsafe.</br>
(Yes, it's safe to share my old passwords as the old accounts are inaccsesible and cannot be logged into.)
