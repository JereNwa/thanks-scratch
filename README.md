Congrats! In one way or another, you've found this! Welcome! This exists as sort of a memorial for Scratch as it's what sparked my passion for coding in the first place.<br/>
Without it, I probably wouldn't have even become as good as coding as I am now.

## Part One - Discovering Scratch
I came across Scratch sometime between 2019 and 2021. Prior to that, I used ScratchJr. Now, ~I didn't have an account at the time, but~<br/> 
~I did make one account, I think. It was called nintendofan200000~<br/> 
Nope, give me a moment while I recollect my memories.

I think I did try to make a few things, back before I made an account...<br/>
...but didn't do very well.

## Part Two - The Creation of My Accounts
In April of 2022, I made my first account. (I think, this is the earliest I can track it down to.) It's called nintendofan200000 and it only had one unshared project: "Cow Dodge! remix". I later shared this after rediscovering it on January 4th, 2025.

BONUS: The account's password is `Pikachu`. Really unsafe.</br>
(Yes, it's safe to share my old passwords as the old accounts are inaccsesible and cannot be logged into.)

That account wasn't supposed to be made, and to this day, I still don't know why it exists.

A month later, I created my real school account called jen3C. You're probably wondering why it's called that. It was due to the naming system that they kept Scratch accounts at our school to up to a certain age. You had to use the first _two_ letters of your first name, and your last initial. As for the 3C bit, that's your school class.

BONUS: The password for literally _every_ Scratch account at the time was `scratch`. Real bad. (Again, the accounts are inaccesible. You won't be able to hack.)

## Part Three - More Projects and Accounts
My first project (which I later unshared and reshared) was called "Super Mario Bros." and it was released on May 27, 2022. It was a remix of BirdNani's Super Mario Bros. On Scratch.

I actually didn't change anything and acted like it was mine (I'm pretty sure that's against the Scratch Community Guidelines.). I even edited the copyright to replace BirdNani's username with mine.

I shared it to my class and they were, to say the least, dumbfounded. they thought it was impossible to make Super Mario Bros. on Scratch. (FYI: It is possible. Check out TTTEfanSQB's project, [Super Mario Bros.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/425822460/))
